                of Western Ontario. Outside of school and coding, I am an active person, I enjoy exercising, running, and playing volleyball.
                I am also a huge traveller, so you can check out some of the places I've been to down below!
                Check out some of the projects I have worked on, and feel free to contact me if you want to learn more about my skills, or just want
                to have a chat about travelling or sports!
